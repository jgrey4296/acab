could allow for file pragmas so:
#Pragma: prefix.blackbox
could set all sentences to be prefixed with a UUID to blackbox the file

#Pragma: prefix.blackbox.directory
could set all files in the directory to the same UUID prefix

#Pragma: prefix.directory
could set file to shared the directory's name as the prefix
