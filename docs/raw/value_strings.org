#+title: Value Strings in Acab
* Value
Simple atoms should convert directly.
so:
a b c
becomes str(val):
"a" "b" "c"
and repr(val):
"<a>" "<b>" "<c>"

If they have a type other than ATOM, repr should include that:
a(::blah) -> <a::blah>

* Instruction

* Sentence
Sentences should join words with fallback modals
and wrap with parens:
"[a.b.c]"

unless its a named sentence, then it wraps in single quotes:
"'query'"

repr should
1) elide the type if its just SENTENCE
2) use '∅' for the name if its anonymous

<∅ [a.b.c]>

named:
<query [a.b.c]>
